            Nothing is known about Seele's birthplace or who her parents were. In early life, she lost both her parents and was then raised in Cocolia Orphanage alongside some other orphans, including Bronya and Sin Mal. Seele had the least potential to be chosen for Cocolia's experiment, however she managed to awaken her power at the last minute and replaced Sin to take part in the X-10 experiment. She did this to save and protect Bronya, only to lead to Bronya chasing after Seele by also participating in the experiment afterwards in hope of finding Seele. The experiment led to a failure that made Seele disappear.

            Seele Vollerei herself is a gentle, sweet, kind, and caring girl, although being rather weak, as she was unable to stand up for herself or for Bronya when both were being bullied by Sin Mal. She also appears to dislike bugs.
            With her insecurity growing, a flower bloomed within Seele; the waking of the Stigma's personality, Veliona. Veliona was like a polar opposite to Seele, being cruel, ruthless and sadistic. Veliona, however, appeared to be affected by Seele's resolve to save and care for Bronya, perhaps even coming to care for Bronya as well. 
            As Seele grows stronger and desires the power to save Bronya, Veliona hears out Seele's request for help and the two come hand in hand as dual-egos.

            A spirited and valiant key member of Wildfire who grew up in the perilous Underworld of Belobog. She is accustomed to being on her own. Like her nickname "Babochka" (Russian: Бабочка Babochka, "Butterfly"), she flits through the battlefield with grace as she causes a storm.
